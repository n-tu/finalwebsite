    <div class="col-sm-6" >Construction Services Group was founded on the principle of attention to detail.  Our strong customer service discipline and un-wavering commitment of adding value is our unique strength.
Our leadership at CSG has combined experience of over 100 years in the building materials industry.  We have completed over 40 million heated square feet of commercial/ multifamily projects in the last 10 years.  Our core staff comes from a 108 year old family lumber business, a 120 year old building materials manufacturer, a 40 year old lumber wholesaler and a national multifamily General Contractor.  Phrases like “on time and within budget”, “the customer comes first” and “follow up and follow through” are common statements throughout our organization.
CSG is not a building materials broker.  We are a construction partner that specializes in inventory, risk and construction management, this is our M³ Advantage™.  Lowering our customers overall cost through a detailed process of project management controls is a main driver.  We are a per plan and spec organization, we utilize a strict mix of inventory controls per building and per phase shipments.  This ensures that the right material is on the job site at the right time.  In doing this, we are able to confidently help our customers save material and time, which results in lowering our customers overall cost and risk exposure.  CSG has expertise in all phases of the construction process and are able to offer “customizable solutions” for each of our customers’ unique needs.
